How to cite P5Grand
=========================

If you have used **P5Grand** to calculate thermodynamic property, please cite the following article:

| "Effect of local strain energy to predict accurate phase diagram of III-V pseudobinary systems: case of Ga(As,Sb) and (In,Ga)As"
| Gyuseung Han, In Won Yeu, Jaehong Park, Kun Hee Ye, Seung-Cheol Lee, Cheol Seong Hwang, and Jung-Hae Choi
| `J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 045104 (2021). <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abbf78>`_


------------------------

If you have used **P5Grand** to calculate average property, please cite the following article:

| "Atomistic prediction on the composition- and configuration- dependent bandgap of Ga(As,Sb) using cluster expansion and ab initio thermodynamics"
| Gyuseung Han, In Won Yeu, Kun Hee Ye, Cheol Seong Hwang, and Jung-Hae Choi
